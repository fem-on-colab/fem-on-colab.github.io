Automated weekly build of end user packages
-------------------------------------------

End user packages [#f1]_ are automatically built on a weekly basis, in order to follow upstream development.

Users that do not wish to be up to date with the upstream development cycle are invited to hardcode in their Google Colab notebooks a fixed release by replacing

.. raw:: html

    <div class="package-installation" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left: 1rem;">https://fem-on-colab.github.io/releases/{install-script}</div>

in the instructions above with

.. raw:: html

    <div class="package-installation" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left: 1rem;">https://github.com/fem-on-colab/fem-on-colab.github.io/raw/{commit}/releases/{install-script}</div>

where ``{install-script}`` is the installation script of the desired package, and ``{commit}`` is the SHA of a commit `in this list  <https://github.com/fem-on-colab/fem-on-colab.github.io/commits/gh-pages>`__ at which the desired version was available.

.. rubric:: Notes

.. [#f1] The FEniCS package is not automatically built, due to the upstream development having moved to FEniCSx.
